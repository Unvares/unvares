## 👋 Hej!

I'm Rick, a full-stack engineer building intelligent web products.

I went from teaching kids how to code at 15 to building AI-powered learning systems, always obsessed with how technology creates impact.

Today I design and ship web apps that combine the accessibility of the web with the depth of academic research — from AI-enhanced writing systems to sustainability projects.

## 🏆 Milestones

💻 **Level 6:** Picked the "Geek" class in life; immediately fell in love with tech.  

🧒 **Level 15:** Joined [Unium](https://unium.ru), Russia's largest after-school education company, as its youngest employee; taught 100+ kids and learned how to explain tech to anyone.  

🧑‍💻 **Level 19:** Joined [Blizko](https://blizko.ru/), a 5 million user eCommerce platform; shipped my first production features used by thousands of real customers.  

🎓 **Level 21:** Built an AI tutoring system and co-authored an [ACM conference paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3605098.3636055) on it.  

🚀 **Level 22+:** Founded [Studeni](https://studeni.se/) to turn AI ideas into real learning tools, grinding for the next boss called making education smarter at scale.  

Each level raised the difficulty from teaching to shipping to leading, but the quest stays the same — driving impact through technology.
