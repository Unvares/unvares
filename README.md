## Backstory
💻 **Level 6:** I had to pick a class. "Geek it is," I thought, and immediately fell in love with tech.

📚 **Level 15:** I chose a subclass: computer science tutor. This opened the option for clan raids on computer illiteracy and community events aimed at promoting a passion for technology in kids.

🎯 **Level 19:** I conquered my first boss: a tech interview at a big corporation. I was offered a position as a front-end developer for an eCommerce marketplace with over 5 million users.

🎓 **Level 20:** I turned to the "game tutorial" – a bachelor's of computer science in Sweden – to search for something deeper than just front-end.

🌟 So here I am, 22 years old, involved with research and innovation in the field of Applied AI, Machine Learning and Education.
