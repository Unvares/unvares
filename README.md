## Hej! My name is Rick

👋 I'm a full-stack web developer and AI enthusiast with a deep-rooted passion for technology and entrepreneurship. My journey began at age 6. Coming from very humble beginnings, I have worked hard to build a great life in Sweden. The amazing people who helped me along the way have inspired me to leverage my love for technology to make the world a better place through innovation.

👨‍🏫 I kicked off my career as a computer science tutor in supplementary education at 15 and smoothly transitioned into web development in 2021. Currently, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science with a specialization in software technology.

🔬 Alongside my studies, I conduct research in applied artificial intelligence and enhance my problem-solving skills through hackathons and additional math courses at my university.

🚀 My goal is to develop a strong foundation in software technology, mathematics, and entrepreneurship to maximize the value I can generate for society. After graduation, I'm open to opportunities in:

- Startups
- Innovative projects in large corporations
- Research institutions

🌍 I aim to choose the path that yields the maximum positive impact per unit of my geekiness
