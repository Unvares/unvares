## 👋 Hej! My name is Rick
🧠 Researching Applied AI at Linnaeus University  
🎓 Full-stack developer, AI enthusiast  
🌍 Maximizing positive impact through tech  

## From a Small Town in Latvia to Researching Applied AI in Sweden
💻 At age 6, I chose my path: tech enthusiast. I fell in love with computers in my hometown of Ogre, Latvia.

📚 By 15, I leveled up to a computer science tutor at Unium, Russia's largest supplementary education provider, leading the charge against computer illiteracy.

🎯 At 19, I conquered my first boss: a tech interview for a software developer position, landing a front-end developer role at an eCommerce marketplace with over 5 million users.

🎓 At 21, I reached a pivotal milestone: securing a research assistant position in Applied AI while pursuing my bachelor's in Sweden. This opportunity marked a turning point in my career.
